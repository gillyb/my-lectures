# Latency & Client side performance  
I prepared this lecture while working @ [Sears Israel](http://sears.co.il/) and I gave it at the [Reversim Summit](http://summit2013.reversim.com/#/) in 2013.  
  
This lecture was prepared using the [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) framework, but on the slid.es site. I downloaded the final PDF but it's a 
little more complicated to export the src - so when I have time, I will do that also.  
  
You can also see a video of this lecture from the Reversim Summit here : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBRK578RVeM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBRK578RVeM) (lecture is in Hebrew)
